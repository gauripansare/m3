        <p>It’s time to start getting organized. Your predecessor left you with a bunch of files saved to the desktop, but you are going to have more, and you need to start organizing them into folders.</p>
        <p><strong>Open File Explorer and then view the Documents folder. </strong><strong>Use the ribbon to create a new folder in the Documents folder</strong> and name it BidsforKids. Open the new folder and move the six files individually from the desktop into the new folder.</p>
